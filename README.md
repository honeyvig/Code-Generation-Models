# Code-Generation-Models
Currently I have an agency that is continually pulling down contracts and it's reaching a point where I can't do all of the fulfillment on my own and hiring more engineers isn't going to help my business scale. I am looking for an AI expert that can come in and research the latest code generation models and multi-agent architectures. If you are interested in this position please submit your proposal with three code generation tools from Github you'd recommend. You will recommend tools I can use to effectively have code generated for my bespoke projects to a reasonable extent. This is going to be a longer term contract and I will regularly need help every week or every few days for the next several months. The work will start with recommending tools and showing me prototypes. Then from there we can grow into a more full time role where you will help me build a code generation platforms that can handle most jobs coming in. But for right now I just need a consultant for an hourly rate every week.

It sounds like you're looking for an AI expert to help you build a scalable code generation platform using the latest tools and architectures. Here's a proposal that includes three promising code generation tools from GitHub, which could be a great starting point for your bespoke project needs. I’ll also outline how they can help streamline code generation tasks for your business.
Proposal: Code Generation Tools for Bespoke Projects
1. OpenAI Codex (GPT-3 API)

    Description: OpenAI Codex is an AI system that can understand and generate code in many languages. By using Codex, you can create custom code generation pipelines tailored to specific contract requirements. Codex supports multiple languages and frameworks, including Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, and more.
    Github: While OpenAI's Codex is not directly available on GitHub, you can use the GPT-3 API via the OpenAI platform. There are many open-source wrappers and projects around Codex on GitHub that can serve as a starting point for integrating it into your workflow.
    How it helps: Codex can be used to automatically generate project-specific boilerplate code, provide code completions, and suggest edits based on specific requirements or documentation.

2. Tabnine

    Description: Tabnine is a popular AI-powered code completion tool that can help speed up the development process by offering intelligent code suggestions. It's based on GPT-3 and works with multiple programming languages and IDEs.
    Github: You can find the Tabnine plugin in GitHub repositories.
    How it helps: Tabnine can automate and suggest code blocks for repetitive tasks, significantly reducing the time spent writing boilerplate code. It’s ideal for streamlining smaller tasks that come up during your contract work, and it integrates directly into many code editors.

3. GPT-4 Code Interpreter (from OpenAI)

    Description: GPT-4 has the ability to generate complex code based on natural language input. It supports multi-agent architectures, helping to automate workflows and generate sophisticated solutions. By fine-tuning GPT-4 for your specific needs, you can create a custom code generation solution.
    Github: Check out the open-source GPT-4 Code Interpreter or related libraries.
    How it helps: You can use GPT-4 to generate highly specialized code for your bespoke projects. This would allow for more personalized and tailored generation across different use cases, as the model can be fine-tuned with your specifications over time.

Multi-Agent Architectures

Multi-agent systems can help coordinate between various AI agents (for instance, generating different pieces of a project or communicating between different APIs). Here are a couple of frameworks that can be useful:

    LangChain
        Description: LangChain is a framework designed to build multi-agent workflows and applications. It allows developers to create complex multi-agent systems that work together to solve problems in a modular way. It can help you design systems where different agents perform tasks such as writing documentation, creating database queries, and generating code simultaneously.
        Github: LangChain GitHub.
        How it helps: LangChain would allow you to develop a more sophisticated system where different agents (e.g., one for front-end code, another for back-end, another for APIs) collaborate to generate code for your bespoke projects.

    Rasa
        Description: Rasa is an open-source machine learning framework for building conversational AI, but it also supports multi-agent workflows. It could be useful for creating a bot system that interacts with different code generation agents, handling contracts and requests.
        Github: Rasa GitHub.
        How it helps: Rasa could manage multiple agents that generate code and handle different parts of a project simultaneously. The framework provides flexibility in designing agents with specific roles, so your code generation system can scale effectively.

How This Helps Your Business

These tools will help you:

    Automate Code Generation: Tools like Codex, Tabnine, and GPT-4 can automate the code writing process, reducing the manual effort you currently spend on generating repetitive code.
    Scale Without Adding More Engineers: By leveraging AI tools and multi-agent architectures, you can scale your operations without hiring additional engineers. Your existing team can focus on more strategic tasks while the AI systems handle the routine coding.
    Streamline Project Fulfillment: With the proper AI models and agent systems in place, you'll be able to fulfill contracts faster and more accurately, ensuring high quality while cutting down on time and costs.

Next Steps

    Prototype Phase: I would start by researching and prototyping integrations for these tools. You’ll get the initial code generation setup working for common contract requirements.

    Scaling: Once the prototypes are successful, we can expand on them and integrate multi-agent architectures (like LangChain or Rasa) to scale your system to handle more complex projects.

    Long-term Collaboration: Over time, I can help you evolve this into a platform that can handle the majority of the workload, freeing up more of your time and allowing you to focus on growing your agency.
